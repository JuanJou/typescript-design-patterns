GOF design patterns implemented using typescript language. I've implemented this patterns in the past, but using Java which is a strongly typed language, so i thought that it could be useful to implement this patterns using Typescript. I've used some of this in the projects that i've worked on but not all of them. Nowadays, Typescript is being a heavly used language in Front End development, and architectures in this technology are beginning to get more and more attention, so i think it's important that this well known patterns that have proven to be succesful in other type of technologies are brought to the front end world. The implemented patterns are: 
- Singleton
- Command
- Abstarct Factory
- Visitor
- Observer
- Iterator
- Composite
- Adapter
- Strategy
