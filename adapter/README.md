# Adapter

  As it's name suggest this pattern help's us to adapt functionality provided for external libraries to match the interfaces that we use in our project. We create a class that maps every function that we are going to use from the library to their corresponding method defined in our interface. Thus, we can join multiple libraries that perform similar operation under one interface, and the rest of our application it's not aware of this.
  In this example, i assume that in this project there are two libraries to perform request to an API, library A and library B. This libraries work very differently, and cannot be used interchangably across de app. To solve this problem, i define an adapter interface that has methods for performing GET and POST request to an API. And then, i created specific adapters,(that match the Adapter interface) for each one of the libraries. Now, to the rest of the application, this adapters can beused with out knowing which of the libraries it's actually performing the operation in the background. Notice, that i also created a service class, that receives an adapter int it's constructor. Then delegates the actual functionality to the proper adapter. Now, if i wanted to add a new libary to perform request, the only thing that i would have to do is create a new Adapter and pass that adapter to the service class.
