# Singleton
This is a creational pattern, which means that it will come into play when we want to create objects. It helps us when we only want to create one object per type. In order to achieve this, what we need to do is implement a way of knowing if an object has been created before for the required type, and if that's the case, instead of returning a new object, we return the previous created object. In this example, i defined an interface that has a method getInstance() and two classes that implement this interface, HttpService and StorageService. So, when we want to create an object of this two classes, instead of calling the constructor function directly, like new HttpService(), we called the getInstance method. This method checks, whether there is an instance all ready created or not. If there isn't then it will create one and return it, this object is the one that will be returned in succeeding calls. 
    Aldo i personaly don't like sharing variables accross an application, this pattern can help a lot when we need for to parts of the code to access the same information. As you can see in the example, the HttpService has a cache attribute, so it makes no sense to have different instances of this class with different cache values. It's better to share this cache accross our whole app, which may result in a faster response time and better user experience.
